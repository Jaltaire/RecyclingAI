# RecyclingAI
Basic TensorFlow neural network creating using TensorFlow for Poets to identify various common beverage bottles.

Can be implemented on a microprocessor (i.e. Arduino) as part of a mechanized recycling sorter to distinguish between contaminated and non-contaminated beverage containers by mass density relative to the known beverafge container inserted into the sorter.
